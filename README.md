Hello World!

Feabhra (pronounced: fee-ahh-ra) here, my username is an Irish word, google it if you want. 
I'm new to programming so there will be alot of mistakes in what I write.
I want to get as much experience as possible before I head off to college to make a career out of this.
Any tips or help in general would be great!
In terms of other hobbies, I don't have much studying for final exams and all, but I do like music, I play guitar...and by that I mean I know a few chords :D
